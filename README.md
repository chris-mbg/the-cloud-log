# The Cloud Log ☁️

❗ **NOTE!** This project is still a WIP and is by all means not finished yet. The project is yet to be deployed.

## Purpose
This application is my final project during my higher vocaltional education to be a front end developer. My goal when deciding on a final project was primarily to explore new techniques, and especially GraphQL. 

### Project idea
The application is a personal weather diary, where a user can add his/hers weather observations, as often as he/she likes and save them all in one place. To each observation with the weather data, such as temperature and precipitation, a personal note can be added. A user will also be able to see other users observations, but not their personal notes. 
The time frame given for the project is only about two weeks, so one challenge is to keep the time frame set. In that short amount of time I did not have the possibility to build my own backend and decided to go for the headless CMS, Strapi. And instead of using the standard REST API that Strapi exposes, I installed the GraphQl plugin. For the frontend part of the application, I have chosen Vue. This is also to push me out of my comfort zone. 

## Technologies used
- Vue 3 with Vue Router 
- Vue Apollo and Apollo Client
- GraphQL
- Strapi with GraphQL-plugin
